Name: GeShiFilter module

Maintainers:  Damien Pitard <dpdev00 AT gmail DOT com>

Dependancies:
  This module requires the third-party php application GeSHi - Generic
  Syntax Highlighter by Nigel McNie <nigel at geshi dot org>.

INSTALLATION:
********************************************************************

NOTE: During this installation process you'll be asked to also 
      install the official GeSHi package from 
      http://qbnz.com/highlighter/.


1. Place the entire geshifilter directory into your Drupal modules/
   directory.

   
2. Download GeSHi latest release from

     http://qbnz.com/highlighter/

   Remember to uncompress the file and make sure the folder is named
   'geshi'.

   
3. Place the entire 'geshi' engine folder (where geshi.php resides)
inside your modules/geshifilter directory. So the Geshi engine will live
in modules/geshifilter/geshi

   
4. Enable this module by navigating to:

     administer > modules

     
5. Set the GeShi filter configuration options by navigating to:

     administer > settings > geshifilter

     
6. Enable the GeShi filter in one of your input formats in:

     administer > input formats

	 This filter should play well with other filters, but
   it might need to be placed after the HTML filter ("rearrange" tab of
   your input format).
   
   You need to configure specific format settings (default language,
    languages allowed...) in the "configure" tab of your input format).
